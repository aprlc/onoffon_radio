## Welcome to onoffon radio

**onoffon radio** is a handmade, online radio not bounded by location, audience, or contributors. Sometimes on, sometimes off, the radio holds space for discussion, casual publishing, knowledge sharing, audio-making, and sonic experimentation.

This project has 2 parts:
1. An online radio which can be accessed [here](https://www.radioo.space).
2. A manual on building an online radio with a Raspberry Pi. The manual can be found on the [website](https://www.radioo.space/manual) or the Wiki of this repository. The manual is a write-up of my personal experience and I envision it as a collaborative document. I invite you to make changes to the wiki as you see fit.
