## Welcome to onoffon radio

**onoffon radio** is a handmade, online radio not bounded by location, audience, or contributors. Sometimes on, sometimes off, the radio holds space for discussion, casual publishing, knowledge sharing, audio-making, and sonic experimentation.

The intention of this project was to build an online radio hosted on a Raspberry Pi prioritizing free and open-source software. More than the radio itself, the value of this project is the manual of my steps in building the radio. I hope the manual will serve as a usual reference for anyone interested in hosting their own micro-radio but please treat it as a non-authoritative document. The manual will be updated by myself if I find better methods and is open for contributions, comments, or edits via this repository's Wiki.
